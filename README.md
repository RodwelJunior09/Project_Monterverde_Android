This is game is made in the Unity Engine: 

Unity Technologies and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively “Unity”) offer a variety of products, services, and websites for game Developers and game players that will be referred to in this policy as the “Service” or “Services.” Because we would like to avoid excessive formality and make this information easy to understand, the policy refers to Unity as “we” or “us” and to the reader as “you.” When we say “device,” we mean any device, including desktop, laptop, PC or Mac computers, smartphones, tablets, or any other device that is used to access or interact with the Service. When we say “Developer,” we mean a third party that develops and/or distributes a game or other app made with Unity software and/or a game using Unity Services. By using the Service, you agree to this Privacy Policy and understand that we may transfer your data outside of the European Economic Area (EEA).

It is important that you read this Privacy Policy together with any other privacy notice or fair processing notice we may provide on specific occasions when we are collecting or processing personal data about you, so that you are fully aware of how and why we are using your data. This Privacy Policy supplements the other notices and is not intended to override them. 

This Privacy Policy governs our information practices for the Service, which includes any websites, where a link to this policy is provided. It describes how we collect, use, share, and protect information from Developers, players, ad recipients, or people browsing or using our sites (collectively “Users”) when Users access or interact with or use our Service. This Privacy Policy also applies to the personal data we collect offline, such as when you call us or interact with Unity in person, such as at an industry event or at a place of business. This includes when Users:

Visit Unity websites;

Choose to interact with the community and forum pages on the Services;

We receive information about Users, their devices, locations and interactions with the Service primarily in two ways:

Actively: When Users actively provide us with information. For example, when a User creates an account with Unity, he or she will type in a name, username, and email address and may be required to provide a date of birth or other information.

Passively: When our systems automatically collect information about browsers, devices, and certain activity within the Service. For example, when Users access games that employ Unity Analytics, or deltaDNA, our systems (with assistance from the Developers who want our help to analyze the use of their games) may automatically collect a variety of information from User devices and/or User game activity, including device name, device characteristics, and unique identifiers (e.g., Apple IDFA and Google Android Ad ID).

Device Information: including various unique identifiers, such as IDFA, Android Ad ID, IDFV, MAC address, when, for example:

You access games provided by Developers that are developed with Unity Software;

You access games in which the Developer employs Unity Analytics or deltaDNA to understand the use of their games and improve the player experience

You receive ads delivered by Unity Ads or mediated by Unity Mediation;

You play games provided by Developers that utilize Unity’s Multiplayer Service;

You access games provided by Developers that offer Unity’s game replay Service; and

Location information: Our systems (like most used on the web) automatically collect an IP address when Users access the Service. IP addresses can be used to learn about the general location (e.g. city, state and country) of the User’s point of access to the web.
Game play activity and actions: When you play a game that uses Unity Analytics, deltaDNA, or other Unity Game Services, certain game activities such as play session information and monetization events are collected. Session information and monetization events may also be collected if certain features of Unity Ads are enabled.

For certain products, a Developer may choose to collect custom data events, and if using Unity Analytics, a Developer may also choose to collect User information such as name, email address, birthdate, gender, app ID or other Developer-defined data parameters. Please note that Unity does not access or use this data collected pursuant to a Developer’s custom configuration.

This app will show you ads through the Unity ads system. Unity Ads has probably collected device information, like IP address and device identifiers, and information regarding the delivery of ads and your interaction with them, all of which may be shared with ad publishers and attribution companies. For clarity, Unity collects the following data: whether you click or tap an ad for a new game, whether you watch the ad or play a game frequently, whether others playing a game like the one you’re playing have downloaded a particular new game, and whether you download and install the new game you see advertised. Where a developer has enabled certain features, Unity Ads may also collect your session information and monetization events. All of this is for purposes of predicting the types of new games that you might like to download. Unity may track additional data about you in the future for purposes of making these types of predictions, and we will notify you prior to new data collection.
